 âœ¨ Welcome âœ¨

I'm a 19 year old boy (he/him) currently in college. I mostly use GitHub for side projects and experiments.

I currently mainly program in C for my new projects, though I occasionally find myself going back to C++ and Python.

I like messing around with computers and I've broken stuff way more times than I'd like to admit.
What I'm working on

    A GZDoom mod based on Sonic Sonic: Lock & Load
    A satirical shell made with the intention of being stupid Something++
    A command line launcher for classic DOOM CmdDoomLauncher

Stuff I use

    Daily driver - iMac 27" (Late 2013)
    Operating system - Arch Linux and Windows 10
    DE/WM - KDE Plasma 5 and i3-gaps
    Mobile phone - iPhone XR
    Code editor - Visual Studio Code and Emacs (my config)
    Drawing app - GIMP and Autodesk Sketchbook
    DOOM source port - Crispy Doom and GZDoom
    Game controller - DualShock 4 and Xbox One Wireless Controller
